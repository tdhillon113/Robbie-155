***SYSTEMS PROGRAMMING AT HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY PROJECT***

Working with a Raspberry Pi 4 and i2c bus on the pi and getting the motor
hat to move and the sensor to detect obstacles. The Robot should then avoid these
obstacles. The following files created:

a. I2c.h and I2c.c (Holds functions for the i2C bus)
b. PWM.h and PWM.c (Holds functions for initializing the motor hat)
c. MotorHat.h and MotorHat.c (Holds functions for sending commands to the
motor hat)
d. Robot.h and Robot.c (Holds functions for moving the robot forward or
reverse, left or right)
e. Sensor.h and Sensor.c (Holds functions for collecting distance data for the
ultra-sonic sensor)
